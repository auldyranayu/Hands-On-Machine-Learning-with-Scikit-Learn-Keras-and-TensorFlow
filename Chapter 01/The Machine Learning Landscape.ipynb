# -----------------------------
# What is Machine Learning?
# -----------------------------
# Machine Learning is a field of computer science that allows
# computers to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.
#
# Instead of writing rules manually, we provide data and let
# the algorithm learn from it.
#
# Examples:
# - Spam email detection
# - Fraud detection
# - Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify)


# -----------------------------
# Types of Machine Learning
# -----------------------------
# 1. Supervised Learning:
#    - Uses labeled data
#    - Examples: Classification, Regression
#
# 2. Unsupervised Learning:
#    - Uses unlabeled data
#    - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
#
# 3. Reinforcement Learning:
#    - Learns through rewards and interaction with environment


# -----------------------------
# Main Challenges in Machine Learning
# -----------------------------
# - Insufficient training data
# - Poor data quality
# - Overfitting (model too complex)
# - Underfitting (model too simple)
# - Irrelevant features


# -----------------------------
# Simple Machine Learning Example
# Linear Regression
# -----------------------------
# This example shows how a machine learning model learns
# a relationship between input and output data.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict new value
prediction = model.predict([[5]])

# Display result
prediction


# -----------------------------
# Conclusion
# -----------------------------
# This chapter introduces the basic idea of Machine Learning,
# different learning types, and common challenges.
# It provides a foundation for understanding advanced topics
# in the next chapters.
