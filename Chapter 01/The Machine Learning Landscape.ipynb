# Chapter 01: The Machine Learning Landscape

## Objective
This notebook reproduces and summarizes Chapter 01 of the book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron.
The goal of this chapter is to understand what Machine Learning is, why it is useful, and the different types of Machine Learning systems.

---

## Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we learn:
- The definition of Machine Learning
- Why Machine Learning is useful
- Types of Machine Learning systems
- Main challenges in Machine Learning
- Testing and validating models

This chapter focuses more on **concepts and theory** rather than heavy coding.

---

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a field of computer science that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules by hand, we provide data and let the algorithm find patterns automatically.

**Example:**
- Email spam detection
- Fraud detection
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify)

---

## Why Use Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is useful when:
- The problem is too complex for traditional programming
- The rules change frequently
- The system needs to adapt from new data

Machine Learning systems can improve automatically as they are exposed to more data.

---

## Types of Machine Learning Systems

### 1. Supervised Learning
The algorithm learns from labeled data.

Examples:
- Classification (spam or not spam)
- Regression (predict house prices)

Common algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm learns from unlabeled data.

Examples:
- Clustering customers
- Dimensionality reduction

Common algorithms:
- K-Means
- PCA

---

### 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

---

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
An agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.

Examples:
- Game AI
- Robotics

---

## Batch Learning vs Online Learning

### Batch Learning
- Trained using all available data
- Needs retraining when new data arrives

### Online Learning
- Learns incrementally
- Suitable for large or streaming data

---

## Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning

### Instance-Based Learning
- Learns by memorizing examples
- Example: K-Nearest Neighbors

### Model-Based Learning
- Builds a model from data
- Example: Linear Regression

---

## Main Challenges of Machine Learning
Some common challenges include:
- Insufficient data
- Poor data quality
- Overfitting
- Underfitting
- Irrelevant features

Understanding these challenges helps in building better models.

---

## Simple Example: Linear Regression
Below is a very simple example of a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression.

---

# %%
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

prediction = model.predict([[5]])
prediction

# %% [markdown]
## Explanation of the Code
- We import LinearRegression from scikit-learn
- We provide simple numeric data
- The model learns the relationship between X and y
- The model predicts the output for new input data

This demonstrates how Machine Learning learns patterns from data.

---

## Model Evaluation
In real Machine Learning projects, models are evaluated using metrics and validation techniques.

Common evaluation methods:
- Train-test split
- Cross-validation

---

## Conclusion
In this chapter, we learned the basic concepts of Machine Learning, including:
- What Machine Learning is
- Types of Machine Learning systems
- Key challenges in Machine Learning

This chapter provides a strong foundation for understanding more advanced Machine Learning techniques in the next chapters.
