## 📘 Repository Overview

This repository is a **comprehensive learning project** that focuses on reproducing,
implementing, and deeply understanding the concepts presented in the book  
*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by **Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly)**.

The project is designed as a **chapter-by-chapter exploration**, where each chapter is
implemented using **Jupyter Notebooks** that combine:
- Practical machine learning code
- Step-by-step explanations
- Clear theoretical discussions

This repository was developed as part of an **Individual Enrichment Assignment for Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses**, with the intention of strengthening both **conceptual understanding** and **hands-on technical skills**.

## 🎯 Purpose and Learning Goals

The main goals of this repository are:

- To build a **strong foundation** in Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts
- To practice **reproducing real-world ML implementations** using trusted libraries
- To understand **why algorithms work**, not just how to run them
- To connect **theory, mathematics, and implementation**
- To create a **personal long-term reference** for future ML projects

By completing this repository, the author aims to move beyond surface-level usage of ML libraries and develop a deeper intuition about how intelligent systems are built.

## 📂 Repository Organization

The repository is organized **by chapter**, following the structure of the book.

Each chapter folder contains:
- 📓 One or more **Jupyter Notebooks**
- 🧠 A **summary of the chapter’s main ideas**
- 📖 **Theoretical explanations** written directly inside the notebook
- 🧪 Executable code that can be run and modified for experimentation

Example structure:

This structure makes the repository easy to navigate and suitable for both learning and review.
